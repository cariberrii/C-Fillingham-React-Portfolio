        Hey there! I'm a front-end web developer raised under the California sun and fine-tuned my skills at the University of the Arts London. With a background in education, photography, and serving both B2C and B2B markets, I bring a mix of creativity and technical know-how to the table.

        I've got big dreams and an even bigger drive to learn and grow. What sets me apart? Well, I see code as a canvas, blending design flair with tech precision to create user-friendly experiences. But it's not just about the tech stuffâ€”I thrive on collaboration and clear communication, making sure projects exceed expectations.

        From coast to campus, I've learned adaptability and curiosity that fuel my coding adventures. Ready to dive into a junior web development or software role where I can blend my creativity, smarts, and dedication to making awesome digital solutions happen!
